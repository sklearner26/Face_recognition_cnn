# Face Recognition(cnn)

This is a face recognition cnn model implemented
using tensorflow


## Techniques used

 - [ImageDataGenerator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator)
 - [MobileNetV2](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNetV2)
 - [Convolution Neural Network](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn)


## Working Description
1.I USE FACIAL DATASET FROM KAGGLE AND MODIFIED IT TO 3 CLASSES

2.THEN I COMPLETELY ANALYSE DATA DOMAIN AND FOUND THAT IT IS COMPLETLY BALANCED

3.THEN I REMOVED CORRUPTED IMAGES THAT ARE FAILED TO OPEN

4.THEN I PERFORM DATA AUGMENTATION USING IMAGEDATAGENERATOR

5.AFTER THAT I USE TRANSFER LEARNING BY USING MOBILENETV2

6.THEN I TRAINED A MODEL WITH TRAINING ACCURACY OF 98% AND TESTING ACCURACY OF 80% DUE TO HAVING LESS NUMBER OF DATA

7.THEN PLOT CONFUSION MATRIX

8.THEN EVALUATE A MODEL BY PRECISION,RECALL,F1SCORE

9.THEN TEST IT WITH RANDOM DATA AND IT PREDICT CORRECTLY

10.THEN CALCULATE NUMBER OF MISCLASSIFICATION AND FOUND 12 OUT OF 60 ARE MISCLASSIFIED
